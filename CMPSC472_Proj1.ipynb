        "each thread will count the amount of words within their given file and output that amount aswell as send it back to the child process.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The allocated memory will be used to communicate between the thread and child process. The word count is what will be allocated, and it will eventually be compared with the parent results.\n",

        "5. **Change Child threads for multithreading processes**\n",
        "\n",
        "The program will now be copied into a separate block to change the structer so that each child will break the source file into parts and then count the words in each part, then finally the sum of the parts will be returned.\n",

        "6. **Send information to the Parent**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that the child processes completed their jobs, the information will be sent to the parent process for evaluation. For the context of this project. A histogram will be used by the parent process to display the results\n",
